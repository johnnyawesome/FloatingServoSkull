# FloatingServoSkull

A floating Servo Skull with laserbeams scanning the environment

It's smoothly animated and floats around on it's own:

 As a huge [Warhammer 40k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_40,000) fan, I thought I'd make a nice floating Servo Skull!
 
 For licensing reasons, I opted to just model a 3D-version of my GitHub Logo (which is a skull, too) in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), and let that one float around.
 
 I designed my GitHub Logo myself and hold the rights to it, so this is fine. This is it, btw:

The project is written in [P5JS](https://p5js.org/) and uses [perlin noise](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noise) in order to create somewhat natural moving-patterns.
